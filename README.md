I don't know what to actually patch, but I know for certain I can find the offsets based on tools which
does this for me. I guess this is just a Python rewrite for patchfinding used in jailbreaks.

So far, only patches I can replicate are from sn0wbreeze. The patches that are going to be added are just
to restore. I will later add in the offsets and instructions needed to jailbreak.

I guess I'm finally getting into to the real patchfinding now. Though it won't be accessible to apps, at least
I can do it from my computer given we already have keys for almost every iOS version, for every device up
to A11, but only A6 and below apply for this project.
