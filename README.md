I have no idea where this is going to go. I've only tested one version, and haven't done anything with the actual  
found offsets. I'm not even sure if these are the correct offsets for every other version. I'm sure they aren't.

I will try to make either something close to a patchfinder or maybe something like fuzzy_patcher. I have no idea.

I also need to fix the return values, they are absolute trash.
